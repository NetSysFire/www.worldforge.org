### #1 - Main Command and Information Window
This window is always present on the screen and provides a primary source of game and system information, the lower section of the window can be used to enter text commands. All game actions including those provided by the graphical user interface can be submitted to the client and server via text commands in this way. The game tab filters messages to those which relate to game play events sent to and from the server. The system tab provides more technical information that is normally not important to typical players but might be useful to developers or world builders.
