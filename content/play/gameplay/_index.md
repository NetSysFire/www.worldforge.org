The default game we provide is one we call "Deeds". This is a world where we allow the players very large freedoms, but
also try to provide both fun and rewarding gameplay.

The freedom is probably what makes Worldforge stick out most from other virtual worlds. In the Deeds world, you're free
to alter the environment to a very large degree. The world is simulated in real time, with plants growing and withering
and animals breeding and dying. Expect the world to always change and evolve.

Our aim is also to make the game self-explanatory, in that you shouldn't have to know much beforehand before venturing
into the world. This is of course something that always can be improved, but it also gives us an excuse for not
providing a too in depth description here.

Just grab the [Ember](/components/ember) client, jump into the world and have fun.
