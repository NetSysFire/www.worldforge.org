The Worldforge project aims to provide tools to allow for anyone to build their own virtual worlds, and others to experience these worlds.

We do this by providing a complete set of software, with everything from servers to clients to protocols and tools. And everything we do is 100% Free Software. That means that you can see all of the code, and make changes to it. In fact, we encourage you to make changes. Impress us!

The project has a long history. We've been doing this for a while, and we're in it for the long haul. We do think we're on to something great, and we want to share that with you. That's why we're encourages you to try out our worlds already today. They might be rough around the edges, and there might be work still to do, but we're hoping that you'll see the potential.

If you think that this sounds interesting and want to help us out we would be delighted. We've even made a whole section of our site into a guide for would be developers. Perhaps you want to help out with coders. Or you're a great artist. Or you have any other skill that might be useful. If so, head over to the [Develop](/develop) section.
