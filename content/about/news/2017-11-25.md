title: "Moving from IRC to Gitter"

Worldforge has for quite some time used IRC for official chat. However, since a couple of years the usefulness have been steadily declined. One of the main disadvantages or the IRC system is that there's no easy way to keep offline conversations going. If you're not logged in you will simply miss out on questions asked and answers given. Given the global nature of the Worldforge project, with users in different time zones, this makes most conversations fruitless.

This is why we've now moved to [Gitter](https://gitter.im/Worldforge/Lobby) instead. We hope that this kind of chat functionality will be better at keeping conversations going.
