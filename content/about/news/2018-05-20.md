title: "SQLite used in Cyphesis"

Our main server, [Cyphesis](https://github.com/worldforge/cyphesis), now uses SQLite instead of PostgreSQL by default.

The main reason for this change is to make the system less complex and to make setup easier. For a long time we've used PostgreSQL as backend for all persisted data. Our persistence needs are however very modest. We only store accounts (created once) and entity state. As such we don't really need a complex database system; it's good enough with a simpler system.

Add to this that a lot of newcomers have had issues with getting postgreSQL properly setup. By switching to a less complex setup with SQLite we hope that it will both make the system easier to reason about and easier to setup.
