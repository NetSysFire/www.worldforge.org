The new Worldforge site is now finally online!

As you probably can see, since you're reading this post, we now have a shiny new web site. The old one was creaking at
the seams, and had been for a couple of years. The new one runs on [Concrete5](http://www.concrete5.org/), a very
competent CMS system. We'll try to keep the amount of pages down, as not to incur a maintenance debt. We'll probably
also be updating the site the nearest couple of days.
