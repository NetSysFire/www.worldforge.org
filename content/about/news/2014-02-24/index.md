Once again Worldforge has had the good fortune to be selected as a mentoring organization
for [Google Summer of Code 2014](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2014)!

This is an awesome opportunity for students to both get more involved in the project as well as get a sweet gig for the
summer. If you’re a student reading this, waste no time getting over to
the [GSoC site](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2014) and read up on how all of this works. Then
swing by the [Worldforge wiki](http://wiki.worldforge.org/wiki/Summer_of_Code) to read up on how this all works specific
to Worldforge. Don’t hesitate to contact us through our
various [channels](http://wiki.worldforge.org/wiki/Main_Page#Communication_Channels).

As previously we’re also acting as an umbrella organization for our friends in the [Ryzom](http://www.ryzomcore.org/)
and [CEGUI](http://www.cegui.org.uk/)projects.

Here is a video showing off student work from previous year, to perhaps serve as an inspiration.
