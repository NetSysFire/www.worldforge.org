The [Open Build Service](https://build.opensuse.org) is a pretty awesome service which allow for (fairly) easy setup of automatic builds of packages on most major Linux distributions. We're currently using it to automate builds of all Worldforge components on OpenSuSE, Fedora, Debian and Ubuntu. Our own little space can be found [here](https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/games:WorldForge).

Check out the current status of the builds [here](https://build.opensuse.org/project/monitor/games:WorldForge). 

Apart from creating RPM and DEB packages there's also support for [AppImage](https://appimage.org/), which is an executable format for Linux. We already have it setup to automatically build the Ember client whenever the source changes.

The final AppImage binaries are put [here](https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/games:/WorldForge/AppImage/), and a direct link to the latest Ember binary can be found at [https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/games:/WorldForge/AppImage/ember-latest-x86\_64.AppImage](https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/games:/WorldForge/AppImage/ember-latest-x86_64.AppImage)

We would love for users to try the client out and report any issues they are having with it. Packaging stuff on Linux can be a bit tricky.
