title: "Ember now conforms to the XDG spec"

I've just pushed some changes to the Ember client which makes it conform to the XDG Basedir [spec](http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html).

The main difference is that the ~/.ember directory isn't used anymore. Instead configuration files are put in ~/.config/ember while data files are put in ~/.local/share/ember.

During startup the contents of ~/.ember will be migrated, and a backup will be made in ~/.emberlegacy.

Many thanks to Olek Wojnar for making the bulk of the changes.
