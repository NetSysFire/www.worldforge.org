title: "New site - same as old"

We've updated the main site. It's now the same as the old, but instead of using a CMS (Concrete5) we've opted for a
simpler approach using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator.

Everything should look pretty much the same as before. We've now also removed the ability to comment on posts and pages,
as this only served as a magnet for spambots.

The source code for the site can now be found at [Github](https://github.com/worldforge/www.worldforge.org). There's
still some work needed. The top task would be to replace the current theme, which was ported in whole from the old site,
for a new one with proper responsiveness. The current site is pretty much useless when browsing on a phone. That could
be improved.
