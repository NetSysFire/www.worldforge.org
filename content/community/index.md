WorldForge uses a number of infrastructure services for communicating and coordinating all the various aspects of the project. Below you will find a short description along with links to visit those services.

### Collaborative Wiki

The [WorldForge collaborative wiki](http://wiki.worldforge.org/wiki/Main_Page) is a great way for community members to document and collaborate on new ideas and implementations. The information and topics found there should be considered a work in progress. In the case of contradictory information being found there you should consider this website to be the official word on the subject except for the archived historical sections.

### Launchpad

[Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/worldforge) provides bug tracking and feature planning through blueprints that provides an overview and roadmap for various project components. If you are interested in getting involved and looking for a task that interests you it is a great place to start.

### Github

All of the code for the libraries, server, and client as well as a number of other tools and components developed by the community are available as [Github repositories](https://github.com/worldforge). You can learn more about how to use Github to acquire and work with services it provides on their website, but to learn how to be a contributing member please visit the [developers](/develop) section of this website.

### Gitter

All communication within the project happens on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/Worldforge/Lobby).
